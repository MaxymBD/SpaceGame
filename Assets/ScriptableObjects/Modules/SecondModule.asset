  Name: Secondary mirror
  Price: 15000
  Description: Once in space, getting these mirrors to focus correctly on faraway
    galaxies is another challenge. Actuators, or tiny mechanical motors, provide
    the answer to achieving a single perfect focus. The primary mirror segments and
    secondary mirror are moved by six actuators that are attached to the back of
    each mirror piece. The primary mirror segments also have an additional actuator
    at its center that adjusts its curvature. The telescope's tertiary mirror remains
    stationary.
