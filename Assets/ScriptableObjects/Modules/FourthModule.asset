  Description: "The telescope uses less power than one might think. In fact, only
    one kilowatt, equivalent to the power used in microwaving your lunch, is needed
    to power the device. NASA said Webb will stay energy efficient more than 1 million
    miles from Earth, reliably powered by photovoltaics. A 20-foot fold-out solar
    array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the \u2018powerhouse\u2019
    for the telescope, supplying energy to all its scientific instruments, communications,
    and propulsion systems. The system is sized at 2 kW to account for the degradation
    that will occur over time due to the harsh conditions of space."
