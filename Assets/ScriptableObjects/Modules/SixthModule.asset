  Description: The sunshield subsystem separates the observatory into a warm sun-facing
    side (spacecraft bus) and a cold anti-sun side (OTE and ISIM). The sunshield
    keeps the heat of the Sun, Earth, and spacecraft bus electronics away from the
    OTE and ISIM so that these pieces of the Observatory can be kept very cold (The
    operating temperature has to be kept under 50 kelvins or -370 deg F).
