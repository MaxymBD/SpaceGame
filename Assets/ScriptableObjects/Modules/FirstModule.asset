  Description: "One of the James Webb Space Telescope's science goals is to look
    back through time to when galaxies were young. Webb will do this by observing
    galaxies that are very distant, at over 13 billion light years away from us.
    To see such far-off and faint objects, Webb needs a large mirror. A telescope\u2019s
    sensitivity, or how much detail it can see, is directly related to the size of
    the mirror area that collects light from the objects being observed. A larger
    area collects more light, just like a larger bucket collects more water in a
    rain shower than a small one."
